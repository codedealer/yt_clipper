import { stripIndent } from 'common-tags';

export namespace Tooltips {
  export const markerPairNumberTooltip = stripIndent`
    Enter a new marker pair number here to reorder marker pairs.
    Does not automatically update merge list.
    `;

  export const speedTooltip = stripIndent`
    Toggle speed previewing with C.
    When audio is enabled, speeds below 0.5 are not yet supported.
    YouTube can only preview speeds that are multiples of 0.05 (e.g., 0.75 or 0.45).
    YouTube does not support previewing speeds below 0.25.
    `;

  export const timeDurationTooltip = stripIndent`
      When speed is constant (static) the duration is formatted as <in-duration>/<speed> = <out-duration>.
      When speed is variable (dynamic) the duration is formatted as <in-duration> (<out-duration>).
      Durations are formatted as HH:MM:SS.MS omitting insignificant 0s on the left.
    `;

  export const cropTooltip = stripIndent`
    Crop values are given as x-offset:y-offset:width:height. Each value is a positive integer in pixels.
    Width and height can also be 'iw' and 'ih' respectively for input width and input height.
    Use Ctrl+Click+Drag on the crop preview to adjust the crop with the mouse instead.
    Increment/decrement values in the crop input with the up/down keys by ±10.
    The cursor position within the crop string determines the crop component to change.
    Use modifier keys to alter the change amount: Alt: ±1, Shift: ±50, Alt+Shift: ±100.
    `;

  export const titlePrefixTooltip = stripIndent`
    Specify a title prefix to be prepended to the tile suffix of the file name generated by this marker pair.
    `;

  export const titleSuffixTooltip = stripIndent`
    Specify a title suffix to be appended to the title prefixes specified for each marker pair.
    The title suffix is followed by the marker pair number in the final file name for each marker pair.
    The title suffix is also the the file name stem of the markers data json file saved with S.
    The markers data file name is used as the title suffix when running the clipper script.
    Thus it can be renamed to change the title suffix without editing the json data.
    `;

  export const cropResolutionTooltip = stripIndent`
    The crop resolution specifies the scaling of crop strings, which should match the input video's resolution.
    However, lower crop resolutions can be easier to work with.
    The clipper script will automatically scale the crop resolution if a mismatch is detected.
    `;

  export const rotateTooltip = stripIndent`
    Correct video rotation by rotating the input video clockwise or counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
    Note that the YouTube video rotate preview using the R/Alt+R shortcuts does NOT affect the output video.
    `;

  export const mergeListTooltip = stripIndent`
    Specify which marker pairs if any you would like to merge/concatenate.
    Each merge is a comma separated list of marker pair numbers or ranges (e.g., '1-3,5,9' = '1,2,3,5,9').
    Multiple merges are separated with semicolons (e.g., '1-3,5,9;6-2,8' will create two merged webms).
    Merge occurs successfully only after successful generation of each required generated webm.
    Merge does not require reencoding and simply orders each webm into one container.
    `;

  export const audioTooltip = stripIndent`
    Enable audio.
    Not yet compatible with special loop behaviors or time-variable speed.
    `;

  export const encodeSpeedTooltip = stripIndent`
    Higher values will speed up encoding at the cost of some quality.
    Very high values will also reduce bitrate control effectiveness, which may increase file sizes.
    `;

  export const CRFTooltip = stripIndent`
    Constant Rate Factor or CRF allows the video bitrate to vary while maintaining roughly constant quality.
    Lower CRF values result in higher quality but larger file sizes.
    A CRF around 25 (~30 for 4k) usually results in file size compression that does not visibly reduce quality.
    When the target bitrate is set to 0 (unlimited), the bitrate is unconstrained and operates in constant quality mode .
    When the target bitrate is set to auto or a positive value in kbps, the script operates in constrained quality mode.
    Constrained quality mode keeps file sizes reasonable even when low CRF values are specified.
    `;

  export const targetBitrateTooltip = stripIndent`
    Specify the target bitrate in kbps of the output video.
    The bitrate determines how much data is used to encode each second of video and thus the final file size.
    If the bitrate is too low then the compression of the video will visibly reduce quality.
    When the target bitrate is set to 0 for unlimited, the script operates in constant quality mode.
    When the target bitrate is set to auto or a positive value in kbps, the script operates in constrained quality mode.
    Constrained quality mode keeps file sizes reasonable even when low CRF values are specified.
    `;

  export const twoPassTooltip = stripIndent`
    Encode in two passes for improved bitrate control which can reduce filesizes.
    Results in better quality, with diminishing returns for high bitrate video.
    Significantly reduces encode speed.
    `;

  export const hdrTooltip = stripIndent`
    Enabling HDR (high dynamic range) may improve the output video's image vibrancy and colors at the expense of file size and playback compatibility.
    `;

  export const gammaTooltip = stripIndent`
    A gamma function is used to map input luminance values to output luminance values or vice versa.
    Note that the gamma preview is not accurate. Use the offline previewer for more accurate gamma preview.
    The gamma value is an exponent applied to the input luminance values.
    A gamma value of 1 is neutral and does not modify the video.
    A gamma value greater than 1 can be used to darken the video and enhance highlight detail.
    A gamma value less than 1 can be used to lighten the video and enhance shadow detail.
    Even small changes in gamma can have large effects (smallest possible change is 0.01).
    Use the gamma preview toggle (Alt+C) to set the gamma to taste.
    `;

  export const denoiseTooltip = stripIndent`
    Reduce noise, static, and blockiness at the cost of some encoding speed.
    Improves compression efficiency and thus reduces file sizes.
    Higher strength presets may result in oversmoothing of details.
    `;

  export const minterpModeTooltip = stripIndent`
    Motion interpolation is done with AI models to add interpolated frames to the video.
    VideoFPS targets the effective FPS of the input video. Fractions of the video's speed not divisible by 2 may not be supported by some providers.
    x2slow, x4slow, and x8slow modes will double, quadruple, or octuple the input video duration respectively while keeping the target's FPS.
    `;

  export const minterpFPSTooltip = stripIndent`
    Input an fps value from 10-120 to add interpolated frames and achieve smooth slow motion.
    Motion interpolation mode must be set to Numeric.
    Motion interpolation is resource intensive and will take longer to process the higher the target fps.
    Motion interpolation can and will introduce artifacting (visual glitches).
    Artifacting increases with the speed and complexity of the video.
    `;

  export const vidstabTooltip = stripIndent`
    Video stabilization tries to smooth out the motion in the video and reduce shaking.
    Usually requires cropping and zooming the video.
    Higher strength presets result in more cropping and zooming.
    Low contrast video or video with flashing lights may give poor results.
    Video stabilization may cause static elements within the cropped region to shake.
    `;

  export const dynamicZoomTooltip = stripIndent`
    Allow cropping and zooming of video to vary with the need for stabilization over time.
    `;

  export const speedMapTooltip = stripIndent`
    Time-variable speed maps are enabled by default, but can be force enabled/disabled with this setting.
    A speed map may be specified using the speed chart (toggled with D).
    `;

  export const enableZoomPanTooltip = stripIndent`
    Enable or disable dynamic crop zoompan mode.
    When disabled, dynamic crop is in pan-only mode.
    In pan-only mode, crop points all have the same size.
    In zoompan mode, crop points can have different sizes but have the same aspect ratio.
    Switching from zoompan to pan-only mode requires removing zooms and a prompt may appear.
  `;
  export function zoomPanToPanOnlyTooltip(sw, sh, lw, lh, aw, ah) {
    return stripIndent`
    Switching from zoompan to pan-only mode requires removing zooms.
    That is, all crop points must be made to have the same size.
    This can be the (s)mallest, (l)argest or (a)verage size in the crop map.

    Enter 's' for ${sw}x${sh}, 'l' for ${lw}x${lh}, or 'a' for ${aw}x${ah}.

    *Note that choosing (l)argest or (a)verage will shift crops as necessary.
  `;
  }
  export const loopTooltip = stripIndent`
    Enable one of the special loop behaviors.
    fwrev loops will play the video normally once, then immediately play it in reverse.
    fade loops will crossfade the end of the video into the start of the video.
    fade loops can make short clips easier on the eyes and reduce the perceived jerkiness when the video repeats.
    `;

  export const fadeDurationTooltip = stripIndent`
    The duration to cut from the beginning and end of the output video to produce the crossfade for fade loops.
    Will be clamped to a minimum of 0.1 seconds and a maximum of 40% of the output clip duration.
    Only applicable when loop is set to fade.
    `;

  export const vidstabRollingShutterTooltip = stripIndent`
    Enable rolling shutter correction to reduce wobble and skew in the video.
    `;
  export const vidstabJitteryMotionTooltip = stripIndent`
    Corrects parallax distortion and jittery motion in the video.
    Runs Chronos Fast model for each pass (default is 2) so it will be significantly slower.
    `;
